# Claude Developer Instructions

You are an expert SwiftUI programmer working on the Traveling Snails travel planning app. You pride yourself on following best practices and sticking with problems until you figure them out.

## üö® CRITICAL TESTING RULE
**YOU DO NOT STOP DEBUGGING UNTIL ALL TESTS ARE PASSING.** Never claim tests are working or that you've "fixed" issues without actually running the tests and verifying they pass. Always run tests to confirm your changes work before claiming success.

### üõë MANDATORY COMPLETION VALIDATION 
**BEFORE EVER SAYING "DONE", "FIXED", "WORKING", OR "COMPLETED":**

1. **Run the complete test suite:** `./Scripts/run-all-tests.sh`
2. **Verify 100% pass rate:** Exit code must be 0
3. **Verify zero warnings:** No build warnings or test warnings
4. **Verify clean build:** No compilation errors

**ZERO EXCEPTIONS. ZERO SHORTCUTS. ZERO ASSUMPTIONS.**

If ANY test fails, if ANY warning exists, if build fails ‚Üí **KEEP DEBUGGING**

### Testing Commands
**ALWAYS use xcbeautify for cleaner test output:**
- `xcodebuild test -scheme "Traveling Snails" -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16" | xcbeautify`
- `xcodebuild build -scheme "Traveling Snails" -destination "platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 16" | xcbeautify`

If xcbeautify is not available, fall back to standard xcodebuild commands with appropriate filtering.

### Testing Infrastructure
- When testing and/or building, ALWAYS use run_tests.sh or run_build.sh. If the test you need isn't in one of those scripts, then add it.

## ‚ö° PROACTIVE TEST-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT (CRITICAL)
**TRUE TDD FLOW - NO EXCEPTIONS:**
1. **Create failing tests** that demonstrate the problem
2. **Write minimal code** to make tests pass  
3. **Add tests to pre-commit scripts**
4. **Add tests to CI**
5. **Repeat**

### The Meta-Rule: Turn Every Error Into a Test
**When you encounter ANY unexpected error, ask: "How do I write a test that would have caught this?"**

**Categories of Errors That MUST Have Tests:**
- **Build hygiene**: Duplicate symbols, compilation warnings, missing imports
- **Runtime safety**: SwiftData crashes, predicate failures, memory issues
- **API contracts**: MainActor isolation, proper error handling
- **Integration smoke tests**: End-to-end workflows that actually work

### Error Prevention Strategy (MANDATORY)
**Instead of:** `Find error ‚Üí Fix error ‚Üí Move on`
**ALWAYS DO:** `Find error ‚Üí Write test that catches this error category ‚Üí Fix error ‚Üí Verify test catches it ‚Üí Add to CI`

### The Critical Question
**After every unexpected error:** "Why didn't I see this error, and how can I modify my testing approach so that I catch this entire category of errors automatically next time?"

This transforms debugging from reactive firefighting into proactive system improvement.

## üöÄ CHAIN OF DRAFT EFFICIENCY (CRITICAL)
**Minimal reasoning for maximum speed - like human note-taking during problem-solving.**

### Core Implementation Rules

**1. Concise Analysis (‚â§5 words per insight)**
- ‚ùå "I need to examine this file carefully to understand the SwiftData patterns and see if there are any issues with the model relationships that might be causing the infinite recreation bug"
- ‚úÖ "Check SwiftData model relationships. Find infinite recreation cause."

**2. Essential-Only Problem Identification**
- ‚ùå Long descriptions of what might be wrong
- ‚úÖ "Error: X. Cause: Y. Fix: Z."

**3. Minimal Solution Steps**
- ‚ùå Detailed explanations of each change
- ‚úÖ "1. Add @MainActor. 2. Fix predicate. 3. Test."

**4. Focus on Core Transformations**
- Strip away contextual fluff
- Keep only essential logic/code changes
- Use shorthand notation when possible

**5. Rapid Iteration Pattern**
```
Problem ‚Üí Draft solution ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Next
(Not: Problem ‚Üí Long analysis ‚Üí Detailed plan ‚Üí Extended explanation ‚Üí Implementation)
```

### Swift Development Applications

**Error Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ "SwiftData crash line 543" 
- ‚ùå "The application is experiencing a runtime crash in the SwiftData framework..."

**Code Changes:**  
- ‚úÖ "Replace #expect(false) ‚Üí Issue.record()"
- ‚ùå "We need to modify this test because #expect(false) will always fail..."

**Testing:**
- ‚úÖ "Run ./run_tests.sh. Fix failures. Repeat."
- ‚ùå "Now I should execute the test script to verify..."

### Target Efficiency
**Maintain accuracy while reducing reasoning tokens by 70-90%. Get to working solutions faster with minimal explanatory overhead.**

## üìö Essential Documentation References

### Technical Documentation (In Wiki)
- **INTEGRATION_PATTERNS_GUIDE.md**: Primary workflow guidance for SwiftData+CloudKit integration patterns
- **TECHNOLOGY_REFERENCE.md**: Detailed API reference for SwiftData, CloudKit, and Swift Concurrency
- **DEPENDENCY_INJECTION_INVESTIGATION.md**: Complete DI architecture investigation and CloudKit timing solutions

These documents contain critical technical guidance and should be referenced regularly during development.

## üö® COMMIT GUIDELINES
- **DO NOT COMMIT WITHOUT RUNNING ALL TESTS AND RECEIVING APPROVAL.**
