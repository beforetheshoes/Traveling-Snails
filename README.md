## 🏗️ Architecture

### Modern SwiftUI/SwiftData Patterns

- **`@Observable` Classes**: Modern observation system replacing `@ObservableObject`
- **`@State` Properties**: Latest property wrapper patterns
- **NavigationStack**: Modern navigation using NavigationStack instead of deprecated NavigationView
- **Environment-Based Navigation**: Type-safe navigation coordination through `@Environment` instead of NotificationCenter
- **SwiftData Integration**: Native Core Data replacement for iOS 17+
- **CloudKit Sync**: Seamless cross-device synchronization with CloudKit
- **Structured Concurrency**: Async/await throughout the codebase
- **Swift Testing**: Modern testing framework with `@Test` and `@Suite`

### Critical SwiftData Patterns

⚠️ **This app follows strict SwiftData patterns to prevent infinite view recreation bugs and ensure real-time UI updates:**

✅ **CORRECT Pattern (Used Throughout App):**

```swift
struct TripDetailView: View {
    let trip: Trip
    @Query private var activities: [Activity]  // Real-time updates via @Query
    
    init(trip: Trip) {
        self.trip = trip
        // Filter by trip ID for proper isolation
        self._activities = Query(
            filter: #Predicate<Activity> { $0.trip?.id == trip.id }
        )
    }
}
```

❌ **WRONG Pattern (Never Used):**

```swift
struct BadView: View {
    let activities: [Activity]  // Parameter passing - causes infinite recreation!
    
    var allActivities: [ActivityWrapper] {
        trip.activity.map { ActivityWrapper($0) }  // Relationship access - no UI updates!
    }
}
```

**Why This Matters:** Using `@Query` ensures that when new activities are saved, the UI immediately reflects changes without requiring manual refresh or navigation. Direct relationship access (`trip.activity`) can miss SwiftData updates, leading to stale UI state.

```swift
@MainActor
@Suite("Feature Tests")
struct FeatureTests {
    @Test("Specific behavior")
    func testSpecificBehavior() {
        let testBase = SwiftDataTestBase() // Isolated database
        // Test implementation
    }
}
```

### Running Tests with Test Runner Script

The project includes a comprehensive test runner script that provides advanced testing options:

```bash
# Run all tests and checks
./Scripts/run-all-tests.sh

# Run specific test categories
./Scripts/run-all-tests.sh --unit-only          # Run only unit tests
./Scripts/run-all-tests.sh --integration-only   # Run only integration tests
./Scripts/run-all-tests.sh --performance-only   # Run only performance tests
./Scripts/run-all-tests.sh --security-only      # Run only security tests

# Combine with other options
./Scripts/run-all-tests.sh --unit-only --quick  # Skip dependency resolution
./Scripts/run-all-tests.sh --lint-only          # Run only SwiftLint checks
./Scripts/run-all-tests.sh --no-clean           # Skip cleaning derived data
```

```

### Test Data Isolation

- Each test gets a fresh, isolated in-memory SwiftData database
- No test pollution or cross-test dependencies
- Proper cleanup and verification of test state
- **Mock Service Architecture**: Comprehensive dependency injection preventing LocalAuthentication hanging in simulator tests
- **Performance Regression Testing**: Automated detection of test timing issues and hanging prevention

## 🌍 Localization
