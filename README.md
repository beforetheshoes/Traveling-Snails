## 🏗️ Architecture

### Modern SwiftUI/SwiftData Patterns

- **`@State` Properties**: Latest property wrapper patterns
- **NavigationStack**: Modern navigation using NavigationStack instead of deprecated NavigationView
- **SwiftData Integration**: Native Core Data replacement for iOS 17+
- **CloudKit Sync**: Seamless cross-device synchronization with CloudKit
- **Structured Concurrency**: Async/await throughout the codebase
- **Swift Testing**: Modern testing framework with `@Test` and `@Suite`

### Critical SwiftData Patterns

⚠️ **This app follows strict SwiftData patterns to prevent infinite view recreation bugs and ensure real-time UI updates:**

✅ **CORRECT Pattern (Used Throughout App):**

```swift
struct TripDetailView: View {
    let trip: Trip
    @Query private var activities: [Activity]  // Real-time updates via @Query
    
    init(trip: Trip) {
        self.trip = trip
        // Filter by trip ID for proper isolation
        self._activities = Query(
            filter: #Predicate<Activity> { $0.trip?.id == trip.id }
        )
    }
}
```

❌ **WRONG Pattern (Never Used):**

```swift
struct BadView: View {
    let activities: [Activity]  // Parameter passing - causes infinite recreation!
    
    var allActivities: [ActivityWrapper] {
        trip.activity.map { ActivityWrapper($0) }  // Relationship access - no UI updates!
    }
}
```

**Why This Matters:** Using `@Query` ensures that when new activities are saved, the UI immediately reflects changes without requiring manual refresh or navigation. Direct relationship access (`trip.activity`) can miss SwiftData updates, leading to stale UI state.

## 🧪 Testing (Swift Testing Framework)

### Test Coverage

- **SwiftData Regression Tests**: Prevent infinite view recreation bugs
- **Unit Tests**: Core business logic and data models
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-component functionality
- **UI Tests**: Critical user flows and accessibility
- **Performance Tests**: Large dataset handling and memory usage

### Test Architecture

The app uses modern Swift Testing framework with isolated test data:

```swift
@MainActor
@Suite("Feature Tests")
struct FeatureTests {
    @Test("Specific behavior")
    func testSpecificBehavior() {
        let testBase = SwiftDataTestBase() // Isolated database
        // Test implementation
    }
}
```

### Running Specific Test Suites

```bash
# Run SwiftData regression tests
xcodebuild test -project "Traveling Snails.xcodeproj" -scheme "Traveling Snails" -only-testing "Traveling_SnailsUnitTests.SwiftDataRegressionTests"

# Run UI component tests
xcodebuild test -project "Traveling Snails.xcodeproj" -scheme "Traveling Snails" -only-testing "Traveling_SnailsUnitTests.UIComponentTests"
```

### Test Data Isolation

- Each test gets a fresh, isolated in-memory SwiftData database
- No test pollution or cross-test dependencies
- Proper cleanup and verification of test state

## 🌍 Localization

### Supported Languages

- English (en)
- Spanish (es)
- French (fr)
- German (de)
- Italian (it)
- Portuguese (pt)
- Japanese (ja)
- Korean (ko)
- Chinese Simplified (zh-Hans)
- Chinese Traditional (zh-Hant)

### Adding New Languages

1. Add language to `LocalizationManager.swift` supported languages list
2. Create new `.lproj` folder in Resources
3. Add `Localizable.strings` file with translations
4. Update `L10n` enum with new localization keys

### Translation Keys

All user-facing strings use the `L10n` enum system:

```swift
Text(localized: L10n.Trips.title)  // "Trips"
Text(L(L10n.General.save))         // "Save"
```
