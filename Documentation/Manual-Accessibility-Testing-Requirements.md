**Expected Results:**
- Content logically grouped
- Group navigation efficient
- Escape routes always available
- No dead-end navigation states

### 3. Voice Control Testing

#### 3.1 Command Recognition
**Test Steps:**
1. Enable Voice Control
2. Use natural language commands: "Add trip", "Edit details"
3. Test numbered commands: "Tap 1", "Show numbers"
4. Use dictation for text input

**Expected Results:**
- Natural commands recognized
- Numbered elements clearly visible
- Dictation works in all text fields
- Command feedback clear

#### 3.2 Complex Workflows
**Test Steps:**
1. Complete entire trip creation using only voice
2. Navigate through trip list with voice commands
3. Edit existing trip details via voice
4. Delete trip using voice commands

**Expected Results:**
- End-to-end workflows completable
- Command recognition accurate
- Disambiguation clear when needed
- Error recovery possible

### 4. Dynamic Type Testing

#### 4.1 Extreme Size Testing
**Test Steps:**
1. Set Dynamic Type to AX5 (largest)
2. Navigate all app screens
3. Test form layouts
4. Verify content readability

**Expected Results:**
- All text remains readable
- No content truncation
- Layouts adapt appropriately
- Touch targets remain adequate

#### 4.2 Content Scaling
**Test Steps:**
1. Test with each Dynamic Type size (AX1-AX5)
2. Verify icon and image scaling
3. Test multi-line text handling
4. Verify button label visibility

**Expected Results:**
- Proportional scaling across sizes
- Content hierarchy maintained
- No layout breaking
- Consistent spacing

## Test Execution Schedule

## Test Documentation

### Test Execution Record
For each test session, document:

```markdown
## Manual Accessibility Test Session

**Date:** [Date]
**Tester:** [Name]
**Device:** [Device Model/OS Version]
**Accessibility Settings:** [Configuration]

### Test Results

#### VoiceOver Navigation
- [ ] ✅ Basic navigation flows
- [ ] ❌ Trip creation (Issue: Empty name not announced)
- [ ] ✅ Data-driven content navigation
- [ ] ⚠️  Error states (Minor: Delay in announcement)

#### Critical Issues Found
1. **Issue:** VoiceOver skips activity count in trip summary
   **Severity:** Medium
   **Steps to Reproduce:** Navigate to trip with activities
   **Expected:** Activity count announced
