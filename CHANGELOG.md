- SettingsViewModel error state management with importError and showingImportError properties for user feedback
- FileAttachmentError enum with specific error types (securityScopedResourceAccessDenied, fileDataEmpty, fileReadError, unknownError)
- ImportPermissionError enum with localized descriptions and recovery suggestions for various import failure scenarios
- Comprehensive ImportPermissionTests.swift following TDD methodology with test cases for permission failures, file accessibility, and error message quality
- **Export Protection Warning**: Enhanced DatabaseExportView with visual warning for users with protected trips, explaining that trip protection status is preserved in exports but data is stored in plain text format
- **Comprehensive Export/Import Test Suite**: ImportExportFixesTests.swift with validation for trip protection preservation and file attachment relationship restoration
- Logo URL and address fields in organization creation form with real-time security validation using SecureURLHandler
- Comprehensive organization address picker tests (OrganizationAddressPickerTests.swift) with TDD approach
- Detailed issue diagnostics in DataBrowserView Issues tab showing specific problematic items instead of just counts
- Expandable issue details with "Show/Hide" toggles for each issue type in database diagnostics
- Smart truncation for large issue lists (first 10 items + "... and X more" indicator)
- Enhanced DataBrowserIssueDetailsTests.swift with comprehensive TDD coverage for issue detail display functionality
- **Reusable Activity Form Components**: Modular section components (ActivityBasicInfoSection, ActivityLocationSection, ActivityScheduleSection, ActivityCostSection, ActivityDetailsSection, ActivityAttachmentsSection) providing consistent UI patterns across add/edit/detail views
- **Edit Mode Support**: Enhanced UniversalActivityFormViewModel with edit mode capabilities for existing activities
- **Comprehensive TDD Test Suite**: 25+ test cases for activity section components following Swift Testing patterns with isolated test data
- **Smart Transportation Icons**: Transportation activities now display specific type icons (‚úàÔ∏è airplane, üöÇ train, ‚õ¥Ô∏è ferry, üöó car, üö≤ bicycle, üö∂ walking) in activity lists instead of generic car icons
- **Real-time Icon Updates**: Transportation type changes in forms immediately update icons without requiring save
- **Error Recovery System (Issue #40)**: Implemented comprehensive error handling throughout the application with automatic retry mechanisms, exponential backoff for network failures, persistent error states across app launches, and context-aware error messages
- **Offline File Support (Issue #40)**: File attachments now remain accessible even without network connectivity, ensuring users can view important documents during travel

### Fixed
- **Export Data Preview Shows Empty Box After Generation (Issue #30)**: Fixed critical UI bug where export preview displayed as empty gray box despite successful data generation. Root cause was combination of `.caption` font being too small for readability, poor contrast with `.systemGray6` background, and lack of error state handling. Enhanced preview with `.callout` font size (significantly more readable), white background with border for better contrast, distinct error state styling with red coloring and warning icons, empty state handling with clear messaging, and performance optimization for large exports with truncation and character count display. Preview now clearly shows export content, errors, and loading states, eliminating user confusion about export functionality
- **Trip deletion navigation not working on iPhone (Issue #34)**: Fixed critical navigation bug where iPhone users remained on deleted trip detail screen instead of returning to trip list. Enhanced UnifiedNavigationView with clearTripSelection notification handler to properly clear selectedItem and navigationPath when trips are deleted. Applied Apple's recommended deletion pattern of clearing navigation first, then deleting data, with explicit sync triggering to ensure CloudKit propagation
- **Trip deletion sync resurrection**: Fixed CloudKit sync bug where deleted trips would reappear after being successfully deleted and synced. Root cause was faulty test simulation logic in SyncManager that was recreating deleted trips from stale cloud test data. Enhanced simulateCrossDeviceSync() to properly detect and remove deleted trips from cloud storage before sync operations
- **iPhone to iPad sync delay asymmetry**: Fixed significant delay in sync propagation from iPhone to iPad (2-3 minutes) while iPad to iPhone was fast (seconds). Root cause was asymmetric configuration where only iPad had periodic sync enabled. Added periodic sync to iPhone (45s interval) while maintaining iPad's faster sync (30s interval) plus enhanced logging for sync trigger diagnostics
- **Critical Security Violations in Logging (Issue #39)**: Fixed sensitive data exposure in debug logs where trip names, activity names, and user details were being logged in plain text. Replaced all `print()` statements with secure Logger framework calls using explicit privacy levels (`privacy: .public`), wrapped all debug logs in `#if DEBUG` guards for production safety, and implemented comprehensive test infrastructure to prevent future violations. Enhanced DebugEmptyTripTest.swift and BiometricLockView.swift with secure logging patterns following ID-based logging instead of exposing model data
- **Password fallback authentication not working (Issue #31)**: Fixed critical biometric authentication bug where password fallback option appeared but was non-functional when biometric authentication failed. Changed LAPolicy from `.deviceOwnerAuthenticationWithBiometrics` (biometric-only) to `.deviceOwnerAuthentication` (biometric + passcode fallback) in BiometricAuthManager.swift. Users can now successfully authenticate with device passcode when Face ID/Touch ID fails or is unavailable
- **Import data permission failures (Issue #13)**: Comprehensive fix for file access permission issues during data import operations. Enhanced DatabaseImportManager with pre-validation checks, proper security-scoped resource handling in EmbeddedFileAttachmentManager, and user-friendly error messages replacing technical error codes. Import operations now gracefully handle permission denials, missing files, corrupted data, and large file sizes with clear guidance for users on how to resolve issues
- **File attachment restoration during import**: Fixed critical bug where file attachments were imported but not linked to their parent activities, lodging, or transportation. Enhanced export format to include parentType and parentId fields, and updated import process to restore attachment relationships correctly
- **Trip protection status lost during export/import**: Fixed bug where protected trip status (isProtected) was not preserved during export/import cycles. Added isProtected field to both JSON and CSV exports, and enhanced import process to restore protection status correctly. Legacy imports without protection field default to unprotected for safety
- **Basic Information section horizontal margin inconsistency**: Fixed ActivityBasicInfoSection container auto-sizing issue by applying Double Frame Pattern (.frame(maxWidth: .infinity) on both content and container), ensuring section takes full width while maintaining centered content design. Resolves Issue #27 alignment inconsistency across all activity view modes (view, edit, add) on both iOS and iPadOS
- Address picker in organization creation form now properly creates and saves address data when selected
- Empty logo URL input no longer incorrectly triggers security validation blocking (empty URLs are now properly handled as acceptable)
- Comprehensive organization navigation tests (OrganizationNavigationTests.swift) with TDD approach
- English localization file (en.lproj/Localizable.strings) with comprehensive translations for all UI elements
- Comprehensive security confirmation tests for Remove Protection functionality
- Photo permission handling with Info.plist usage descriptions for NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription and NSCameraUsageDescription
- **BiometricAuthManager LAContext Hanging Issue**: Fixed critical issue where LAContext.evaluatePolicy() calls were causing test timeouts and intermittent authentication failures (Issues: testSyncAuthenticationInteraction, testCompleteTripLifecycle, testBiometricAuthManagerAvoidHanging timing out at 2.4-3.3 seconds instead of expected < 2-3 seconds). Root cause was incorrect conditional compilation hierarchy where test detection was nested inside device-only blocks, allowing LAContext creation during test execution. Applied comprehensive fix restructuring biometricType, canUseBiometrics(), and authenticateTrip() methods to prioritize test detection FIRST before any LAContext operations, ensuring LAContext is never created during ANY test execution regardless of simulator vs device configuration. All previously failing biometric authentication performance tests now consistently pass under 2 seconds
- **Test Infrastructure Improvements**: Fixed numerous hanging tests that were causing test suite failures
  - Added state cleanup patterns to prevent test contamination in SettingsViewTests, BasicAppSettingsTests, TripSwitchingTests, PhotoPermissionTests, and ColorSchemeIntegrationTests
  - Fixed BiometricAuthManager singleton usage in tests by adding proper test environment detection

- Enhanced UnifiedFilePicker with proper permission checking, error handling, and user education alerts
- **Transportation icon inconsistency**: Activity lists now show specific transportation type icons instead of generic car icon for all transportation activities
- **Static form icons**: Transportation type changes in both create and edit modes now immediately update form header and section icons
- **Network Error Recovery (Issue #40)**: Fixed app crashes and data loss during network failures by implementing comprehensive error recovery with automatic retry, proper error state preservation, and graceful degradation when offline
