# Testing Intelligent Pre-commit Hook System

This file tests the intelligent pre-commit hook system.

## System Features

1. **Fast Validation** - For documentation changes like this one
2. **Full Validation** - For UI, security, or data model changes  
3. **Async Validation** - For major features that need comprehensive testing

The system should detect this as a documentation change and use fast validation.
